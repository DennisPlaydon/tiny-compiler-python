# tiny-compiler-python

This is a rewrite of [Jamie Kyle's super-tiny-compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler). The original super-tiny-compiler is so fun to try. It is very clear and explains the core concepts well.

I decided I would learn best if I rewrote the compiler in another language rather than simply reading the implementation. Hence tiny-compiler-python was born.

The main entry point of the project is `compiler.py`
